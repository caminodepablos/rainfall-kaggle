# Rainfall Dataset - Stacking Model
## Stacking Model for Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset - Kaggle Playground Series

### Description

I developed this machine learning model as part of the Kaggle Playground Series competition. The goal was to predict whether it will rain or not using a Tree Model approach, primarily based on Random Forest. My final model achieved a score of **0.90129**.

### Kaggle Competition

You can find the Kaggle competition details here:

### Streamlit App

I have deployed an interactive Streamlit app where you can test the model in real-time:
[Check out the Streamlit App](https://rainfall-binary-prediction-kaggle-dataset.streamlit.app/)

### Features

- Dataset: Rainfall data from Kaggle Playground Series
- Model: Random Forest
- Performance: Achieved a score of 0.90129
- Deployment: Interactive visualization via Streamlit
